# spam-mail-detection
# 📧 Spam Mail Detection

A machine learning based spam email detector. Given an email text, this app classifies whether it is **spam** or **non-spam (ham)** using text processing and vectorization.

## 🧮 Project Overview

This project builds a spam detection model by training on a dataset of emails, extracting text features, vectorizing them, and then using a classifier to predict spam vs non-spam. There's also a Streamlit web app so you can try detection in a UI.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|---|-------------|
| `spam_detect.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, training the model, and evaluation. |
| `app.py` | Streamlit app interface for users to input email text and receive prediction. |
| `model.pkl` | Trained model for predictions. |
| `vectorizer.pkl` | Text vectorizer (e.g. CountVectorizer or TF-IDF) used to transform emails into features. |
| `spam.csv` | Dataset of email messages labeled as spam or ham. |
| `spam_words.csv` / `non_spam_words.csv` | Vocabulary or word lists extracted during preprocessing (if used). |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies required to run the app and training. |

## 🚀 How to Use / Run

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHIVAREDDY2005/spam-mail-detection.git
   cd spam-mail-detection
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook (optional, for training / exploration)
Open spam_detect.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab to see how the model was built, evaluated, and vectorized.

Run the Web App

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Then open the local address shown (e.g. http://localhost:8501) to try out the spam detection interface.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python – Core language

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling & preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Model training, vectorization, metrics

Streamlit – Web app UI for interactive predictions

Pickle – For saving/loading model & vectorizer

Jupyter Notebook – For experiments, EDA, and evaluation

🔍 Model & Methodology
Text preprocessing: Cleaning email text, removing punctuation, lowercasing, stop words removal (if applicable)

Feature extraction: Using techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF via vectorizer.pkl

Model training: Using a classification algorithm (e.g. Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / etc.)

Evaluation: Checking accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc. to ensure performance

🛠 Potential Improvements & Future Work
Use more advanced text preprocessing (e.g. lemmatization, word embeddings)

Try more sophisticated models (e.g. deep learning, transformer-based)

Expand dataset for more diverse spam samples

Add UI improvements: show probability, highlight spam keywords, etc.

Deploy the app online for public use
